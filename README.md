Converting RaspberryPi into Router with the help of USB dongle

Our team, consisting of Karim, Mohammed, and Ntsapi, recently completed an exciting group project. The goal was to configure a Raspberry Pi and a USB dongle to function as a router. Although we were initially given two weeks to complete the task, we managed to finish it within a few days once we had all the necessary devices.

The team was composed of two Pentesters, Karim and Ntsapi, and one SOC Analyst, Mohammed. In this project, Mohammed was responsible for configuring the devices. Meanwhile, the Pentesters, Karim and Ntsapi, focused on exploiting the setup to identify vulnerabilities and attempt to crack the password. Simultaneously, Mohammed monitored the activities using tools like Splunk, ensuring that the entire process was closely observed and analyzed.
